# NFT-Landing--exam-1
Responsive mobile html creating exam. Using html samples from wwww.figma.com
it is first repository and first readme.md
work is made only for 2 variants: 428x3300px and 1440x3300px (like in figma.com samples)
most dificult/ most problems I found with 3 image files: background.svg, graphic.png/svg, upsell-footer-image.svg is it pasible, they are not stable fixed on every time, than will be open file on browser
so, it is not the perfect result, but heavy ant very interesting and good the expirience
have a nice view :)
2022-04-10 I made second, more quality variant of same job and replased it like new branch
